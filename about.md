Hey there! My name is Avi. 

I have written on the internet before; I had a couple of childish blogs in college and still have hundreds of unpublished and unfinished drafts on Medium. Medium fascinated me, as it disconnected me from the distractions of making things look perfect. However, with the endurability of the platform and ownership of my writing under question, I decided to look for an alternative. 

So here I am, on my very own blog. Expect no continuity of themes here, my writing wanders as my mind does; I might indulge you in a bit of commentary on media, technology and politics one day and surprise you with a haiku the next.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avidiotic). I also like to occasionally put up pictures and stories on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/avidiotic). 

I would like to thank [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for this beautiful and elegant theme.

Thanks for reading!
